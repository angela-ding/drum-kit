# Drum Kit

This site is deployed at: https://angela-ding.github.io/drum-kit/

This is a playable drum kit, made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Functionality includes:
* Users can click on the screen to play the different sounds
* Users can also use their keyboard to play the sounds

## What I learned:
* Using HTML and CSS to create the webpage layout and styling
* Using Javascript for DOM manipulation and form validation
* Using Javascript to register keyboard clicks

This project is stricly in front-end.
